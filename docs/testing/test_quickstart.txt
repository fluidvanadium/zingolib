PREREQUISITES

$ cargo install cargo-nextest --locked

install git-lfs


EXPLANATION

there are two categories of integration tests:
> those running against zcashd's regtest mode (integration tests)
  see ./ZINGOCLI-REGTEST.mtd

> those running against lightwalletd's darkside mode (darkside tests)
  see ./TEST-DARKSIDE.md

git-lfs downloads binaries (lightwalletd, zcashd, zcash-cli) to test against
they are installed during cargo build to zingo-testutils/test_binaries/bins
	
the union can be run simply with
$ cargo nextest run
or run a specific test with
$ cargo nextest run --features test {TESTNAME} --nocapture

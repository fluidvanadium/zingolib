PREREQUISITES

$cargo install cargo-nextest --locked

install git-lfs in order to download test binaries (lightwalletd, zcashd, zcash-cli) to test against


EXPLANATION

there are two categories of integration tests: those running against zcashd's regtest mode (integration tests) and those running against lightwalletd's darkside mode (darkside tests)

each of these modes is described in more detail in another document in this folder

the union can be run simply with
$ cargo nextest run

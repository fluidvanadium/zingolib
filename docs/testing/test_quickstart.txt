PREREQUISITES

$cargo install cargo-nextest --locked

install git-lfs in order to download test binaries (lightwalletd, zcashd, zcash-cli) to test against


EXPLANATION

there are two categories of integration tests:
> those running against zcashd's regtest mode (integration tests)
  see ./ZINGOCLI-REGTEST.mtd

> those running against lightwalletd's darkside mode (darkside tests)
  see ./TEST-DARKSIDE.md

the union can be run simply with
$ cargo nextest run

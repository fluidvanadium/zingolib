Zingo! A Zcash Application

Use zero knowledge cryptography to manage your transaction history in a private and mindful way.

Take exclusive and unique control over your history. Use this unique insight into your
own financial behavior to introspect on how you spend money. Share
insights on your terms. Establish healthy relationships with diverse economic communities.

Only you have the power to share your information! Your perspective matters. You matter.

When you send Zcash you can write a memo containing anything you like. When you receive
Zcash you also receive the memo that the Sender wrote. In most cryptocurrencies wallets
routinely send transactions to themselves to recover "change" from the transaction.  In this case, where
the application is both the Sender and the Receiver, Zingo uses the memo system to write
notes to itself about the transactions it builds for the User.

Zingo uses on-chain memos to store information associated with your transactions. The client
extracts that data to provide insights exclusively to you.  Your data is never exposed to any
third party.  By providing Users with private insight into their own economic behavior, we
are enabling everyone to make healthier financial decisions. We anticipate diverse communities
that form around different kinds of insights, to collaborate on shared values.
